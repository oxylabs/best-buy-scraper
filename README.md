# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal_ecommerce',
    'url': 'https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-flip4-128gb-unlocked-graphite/6512618.p?skuId=6512618',
    'geo_location': 'United States',

}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('user', 'pass1'),
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with the result.
pprint(response.json())
```
